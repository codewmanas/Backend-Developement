## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to learning and mastering backend development. It serves as a structured guide for understanding core backend concepts, building scalable APIs, and working with modern backend technologies. Each folder in this repository represents a specific topic or technology explored during the learning process.

## Tech Stack
The following technologies and tools are used throughout this repository:
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for creating RESTful APIs.
- **Redis**: In-memory data structure store for caching and message brokering.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing and managing application data.
- **Postman**: API testing and development tool.

## Folder Structure
Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific topic or technology:
- `01-node-basics/`: Fundamentals of Node.js.
- `02-express/`: Building APIs with Express.js.
- `03-redis/`: Implementing caching and message queues with Redis.
- `04-mongodb/`: Working with MongoDB for data persistence.
- `05-api-testing/`: API testing and debugging using Postman.
